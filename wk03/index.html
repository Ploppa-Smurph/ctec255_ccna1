     - Fiber-Optic Cabling
     - Wireless Media
<h3>4.1 Purpose of the Physical Layer</h3>
<h4>4.1.1 Physical Connection</h4>
     physical connection from an outside network to a local network is established
       a physical connection can be cabling or wireless (radio waves) 

     - wired networks have cabling physically plugged into shared switches
     
     - wireless network no cables - uses radio waves to attach to wireless router or wireless access point

    <b>Network Interface Card (NIC)</b> - Ethernet or Wireless (WLAN) or both 
<h4>4.1.2 Physical Layer</h4>
      the Physical Layer takes the 'Completed Frame' from the DataLink Layer (Layer 2) and <b><i>Encodes</i></b> 
        the packet into signals and transmits the <i>Frame</i> over local media

      the Physical layer is the LAST step of the encapsulation process and the FIRST step of the re-encapsulation process 
     
<h3>4.2 Physical Layer Characteristics</h3>
<h4>4.2.1 Physical Layer Standards</h4>
      Standards address 3 funcitonal areas:
        - Physical Components
        - Encoding
        - Signaling

    Physical Layer Standards (Level 1 and some Level 2) are built into the hardware and are governed by various organizations
        - IEEE
        - ANSI
        - ISO
        - EIA/TIA

    ** conversely TCP/IP (some Layer 2 - Layer 7) standards are implemented at the <i>Software level</i> and governed by the IETF 
<h4>4.2.2 Physical Components</h4>
      Hardware Devices
      Cabling Media
      Connectors
      NICS 
      Interfaces

      all under the standards of the Physical Layer
<h4>4.2.3 Encoding</h4>
       <b>Encoding</b> - converts the stream of bits into a format recognizable byt the next device in the network 

       ex: of encoding: 
            - Manchester (0 in the valley, 1 at the top of a square wave) - voltage over time (getting phased out because it is too slow for modern processes)
            - 4B/5B 
            - 8B/10B
<h4>4.2.4 Signaling</h4>
        signaling is how the bit values are represented on the physical medium 
         signaling varies by the type of medium used

         Copper Cable - clunky square wave representation of voltage over time
         Fiber Optic  - light pulse over period of time 
         Microwave over Wireless: 
            Digital Signal - regular boxy square wave
            AM             - large fat waves 
            FM             - tighter waves with more steep peaks and valleys
            PM             - extremely ordered wave grouping with regular repeat, wave with some short peaks
<h4>4.2.5 Bandwidth</h4>
        Bandwidth is the capacity at which a medium can carry data

        - <b><i>Digital Bandwidth</i></b> - mesures amount of data flowing from one place to another in a give amount of time 
              bits transmitted / second 

        - the properties of the physical media, current technologies, and laws of physics play a role in determining available bandwidth

        <b>bps</b>    = Bits per second
        <b>Kbps</b>   = Kilobits per second 
        <b>Mbps</b>   = Megabits per second
        <b>Gbps</b>   = Gigabits per second
        <b>Tbps</b>   = Terabits per second
<h4>4.2.6 Bandwidth Terminology</h4>
      <b>Latency</b> - amount of time, including delays, for data to travel 
      
      <b>Throughput</b> - measure of transfer of bits across media over a given period
      
      <b>Goodput</b> - measure of usable data transferred over a given period
          <i>Goodput = Throughput - Traffic Overhead</i>   

<h3>4.3 Copper Cabling</h3>
<h4>4.3.1 Characteristics of Copper Cabling</h4>
        most common and inexpensive cabling medium for networking 
           includes both Coaxial cable and Cat5, Cat6 style RJ-45 connector cabling 

      Limitations:
        - Attenuation - longer the electrical signals have to travel, the weaker they get.
        
        - electrical signal is susceptible to interference for EMI (Electro Magnetic Interference) or 
             RFI (Radio Frequency Interference)

      Mitigations: 
        - Adherence to cable length limits mitigates attenuation
        - some cables are shieled to mitigate EMI and RFI 
        - some cable mitigate 'Crosstalk' by twisting opposing circuit pair wires together       
<h4>4.3.2 Types of Copper Cabling</h4>
      <b>Coaxial</b> -

      <b>Cat5/Cat6/Cat7</b> - RJ-45 connector on end - 8 wires - into 4 twisted pairs
      <b>UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair</b> - most common, less expensive then shielded
      <b>STP Shieleded Twisted Pair</b> - needed for some situations and to adhere to certain standards
<h4>4.3.3 Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP)</h4>
        - Terminated with RJ-45 connector
        - used to interconnect hosts with intermediary network devices

        Key Characteristics of UTP:
        1) outer jacket protects copper wire from physical damage
        2) twisted pair protects from signal interference
        3) color-coded plastic insulation electracially isolates wires and identifies each pair
<h4>4.3.4 Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP)</h4>
       has an outer buffer shield (braided foil) to protect from EMI/RFI  
            - better noise protection than UTP
            - more expensive 
            - more difficult to install than UTP        
<h4>4.3.5 Coaxial Cable</h4>
       solid copper core -> thick plastic/teflon insulation -> woven copper braid / foil weave -> thick outer jacket 
        
       3 major connector types: 
         <i>BNC</i>    - push and twist on 
         <i>N Type</i> - similar to F type, not widely used, screw on
         <i>F Type</i> - screw on (like what I am used to)

<h3>4.4 UTP Cabling</h3>
<h4>4.4.1 Properties of UTP Cabling</h4>
        each UTP cable has 4 twisted pairs = 8 wires total
            - orange / striped orange
            - blue / striped blue 
            - green / striped green
            - brown / striped brown

     UTP limits <i>'crosstalk'</i>:
       - Cancellation - each wire in the pair uses opposite polarity (1 wire is negative and 1 positive)
       - Variation    - the twists per foot of each wire is varied as to limit crosstalk amongst the wires in the cable 
      
<h4>4.4.2 UTP Cabling Standards and Connectors</h4>
        UTP standars are established by TIA/EIA and deal with: 
          - cable length
          - connectors
          - termination of cable

        IEEE establishes the Electrical Standards for the cable
          - Cat 3 (telephone - not twisted pair)
          - Cat 5 (UTP)
          - Cat 6 / Cat 7 (faster UTP)

        RJ-45 connector -- pin 1 on left hand side / pin 8 on far right (tab facing down)
<h4>4.4.3 Straight-Through and Crossover UTP Cables</h4>
        T568-A or T568-B  (T568-B is more common) -- will need to memorize
          -- both A & B start at pin 1 with a stripe 
           A = stripe green  -> pin 1                 B = stripe orange   -> pin 1
               green         -> pin 2                     orange          -> pin 2
               stripe orange -> pin 3                     stripe green    -> pin 3
               blue          -> pin 4                     blue            -> pin 4  
               stripe blue   -> pin 5                     stripe blue     -> pin 5   
               orange        -> pin 6                     green           -> pin 6  
               stripe brown  -> pin 7                     stripe brown    -> pin 7  
               brown         -> pin 8                     brown           -> pin 8

    <b><i>Ethernet Straight-Through</i></b> - both ends of the cable are T568-A, or T568-B -- both ends are the same
         -> link Host to Network Device

    <b><i>Ethernet Crossover</i></b>        - one end T568A and the other T568B; used for Host-Host, Swith-Switch, or Router-Router communication 
         -> link between 2 of the same network devices

         crossover swaps the transmit and the receive on the ends, 1 is a transmit end, the other is a receive end

    <b><i>Rollover (Cisco)</i></b>          - Cisco proprietary wiring; 
         -> host serial port to Router / Switch Console Port using an adapter  
<h3>4.5 Fiber-Optic Cabling</h3>
<h4>4.5.1 Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling</h4>
       - very fast - ideal form many networking scenarios
       - transmits over longer distance at higher bandwidth than other media 
       - immune to EMI/RFI 
       - Uses laser or LED to encode bits as pulses of light with minimum signal loss
<h4>4.5.2 Types of Fiber Media</h4>
       <b>SMF Single Mode Fiber</b> - small core, uses laser, long distance application 

       <b>MMF Multimode Fiber</b> - larger core, uses LEDs transmitted at different angles
              up to 10Gbps over 550 meters

     <b>Dispersion</b> - spreading of light pulse over time; increased loss of signal strength         
      MMF has greater Dispersion than SMF 
      SMF has less loss over time
<h4>4.5.3 Fiber-Optic Cabling Usage</h4>
      <b>Enterprise Networks</b> - backbone cabling and interconnecting infrastructure devices 

      <b>Fiber to the Home (FTTH)</b> - always-on broadband for home and small office 

      <b>Long Haul Networks</b> - used by service providers to connect cities and countries 

      <b>Submarine Cable Networks</b> - provides reliable high-speed / higg-capacity solutions capable of survivign harsh undersea environments

     this course will focus on <i>Enterprise Networks</i> 
<h4>4.5.4 Fiber-Optic Connectors</h4>
       Fiber is a <b><i>'half duplex'</i></b> transmission media --- can only transmit or receive at 1 time 
        ST (Straight Tip) connector - push and twist, looks similar to coaxial connection
        
        Subscriber Connector (SC) - largish connector - often used in home theater devices 

        Lucent Connector / Simplex Connector - has the external push release tab, smaller and more common today 

        Duplex Multimode LC Connector - 2 LC connectors per end (1 wire to transmit, 1 wire to receive)
            -- allows fiber connection to be duplex by having a dedicated transmit and receive connection to a device
         Duplex LC connector is about the same size as an RJ-45 port and some devices let you swap from copper to fiber by repalcing a port on the device   
<h4>4.5.5 Fiber Patch Cords</h4>
        have to make certain that cable has the correct SMC or MMC for the device it is connecting to
