<h1>CTEC-255 wk 02 CCNA 01 module 03 Protocols and Models</h1>
<pre>
<h2>03.0 Introduction</h2>
<h3>03.0.1 Why take this module?</h3>
<h3>03.0.2 What will I learn to do in this module?</h3>
<h3>03.0.3 Activity - Design a Communications System</h3>

<h2>03.1 The Rules</h2>
<h3>03.1.1 Video - Devices in a Bubble</h3>
        IP  - delivery of packets
        TCP - reliability
<h3>03.1.2 Communications Fundamentals</h3>
        Message Source (sender) - people or electronic device that initiate communication  
        Message Destination (receiver) - receives message and interprets it
        Channel - media pathway over which the message travels
<h3>03.1.3 Communication Protocols</h3>
         communication is governed by protocols
         protocols are the rules that are established and agreed upon in order for communication to occur
<h3>03.1.4 Rule Establishment</h3>
        protocols assure proper formatting
            - An identified sender and receiver
            - Common language and grammer
            - Speed and timing of delivery
            - Confirmation of acknowledgment requirements
<h3>03.1.5 Network Protocol Requirements</h3>
        - message encoding
        - message formatting and encapsulating
        - message size
        - message timing 
        - message delivery options
<h3>03.1.6 Message Encoding</h3>
    Encoding -  process of converting information into another acceptable form for transmission
      Message Source -> Encoder -> Transmitter -> Transmission Medium -> Receiver -> Decoder -> Message Destination
<h3>03.1.7 Message Formatting and Encapsulation</h3>
    Formatting depends on type of message and channel used to deliver message
<h3>03.1.8 Message Size</h3>
     the message is broken down into 'Frames' of smaller size and transmitted that way
       - destination host 'decodes' the received information -- destination host interprets the message
<h3>03.1.9 Message Timing</h3>
    - Flow Control: defines how much information and the speed at which it can be delivered  
    - Response Timeout: specifies how long to wait for response and what action to take if a response timeout occurs
    - Access Method: determines when messages can be sent to avoid 'collision of information'
           - Proactive protocols attempt to prevent collisions
           - Reative protocols establish a recovery method after the collision occurs
<h3>03.1.10 Message Delivery Options</h3>
    - unicast: transmitted to a single end device
    - multicast: sendss to one or more end devices 
    - broadcast: sends to ALL end devices (not available on IPv6)
    - anycast: available on IPv6
<h3>03.1.11 Note about the Node Icon</h3>
    nodes are illustrated as circles throughout the course
<h3>03.1.12 Check Understanding</h3>
    - process of converting information to proper form for transmission? 
      -- encoding
    - step of communication process that is concerened with properly identifying address of sender and receiver?
      -- formatting 
<h2>03.2 Protocols</h2>
<h3>03.2.1 Network Protocol Overview</h3>
       Protocols - rules on how we communicate
       Network Protocols - define a common set of rules that can be implemented on
          - Software
          - Hardware
          - Both
        Protocols have their own:
          - Function
          - Format
          - Rules

      <b>Network Communication Protocol</b> - enable 2 or more devices to communicate over 1 or more networks
      <b>Network Security</b> - secure data to provide authentication, data integrity, and data encryption 
      <b>Routing</b> - enable routers to exchange route information, compare path information and select best path
      <b>Service Discovery</b> - used for automatic detection of devices or services  
<h3>03.2.2 Network Protocol Functions</h3>
      Protocols may have 1 or more functions
       <b>FUNCTION</b>                       <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b><i>Addressing</i></b>             - Identifies sender and receiver
       <b><i>Reliability</i></b>            - Provides guranteed delivery
       <b><i>Flow Control</i></b>           - Ensures data flows at an efficient rate
       <b><i>Sequencing</i></b>             - Uniquely labels each transmitted segment of data 
       <b><i>Error Detection</i></b>        - Determines if data became corrupted during transmission
       <b><i>Application Interface</i></b>  - Process-to-Process communications between network applications
<h3>03.2.3 Protocol Interaction</h3>
    Networks require the use of several protocols each with a unique function and format:

    <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b>  - Governs way web server and web client interact; defines content and format
    <b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</b> - Manages individual conversations; Provides guranteed delivery; Manages flow control
    <b>Internet Protocol (IP)</b>              - Delivers messages globally for the sender to receiver
    <b>Ethernet</b>                            - Delivers messages from 1 NIC to another NIC on the same Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN) 
<h3>03.2.4 Check Understanding of Protocols</h3>
        <b>BGP</b> and <b>OSPF</b> are examples of which type of protocols?
           -- BGP and OSPF are routing protocols, they enable routers to exchange route information to reach remote networks
<h2>03.3 Protocol Suites</h2>
<h3>03.3.1 Network Protocol Suites</h3>
        Network Protocol Suites are inter-related protocols grouped together to perform a communication function

        Protocol Stacks - help visualize how protocols within a suite are implemented
          lower layer protocols are concerned with moving data 
          higher layer protocols are focused on the content of the message being sent
<h3>03.3.2 Evolution of Protocol Suites</h3>
        Internet Protocol Suite = TCP / IP
          most common protocol; maintained by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
        Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) / aka (ISO)
          developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  
        AppleTalk - Proprietary Apple Suite - not really used anymore
        Novell NetWare - Proprietary Suite from Novell - not very common
        
        the TCP/IP Layer of the TCP/IP model / DOD Model: 
            Application Layer of TCP/IP   = HTTP, DNS, DHCP, FTP
            Transport Layer of TCP/IP     = TCP, UDP
            Internet Layer of TCP/IP      = IPv4 & IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6 
            Network Access Layer          = Ethernet, ARP, WLAN   
<h3>03.3.3 TCP/IP Protocol Example</h3>
      TCP/IP protocols operate at application, transport, and internet layers
        - the most common network access layer LAN protocols are Ethernet and WLAN (Wireless LAN)

     Application Layer: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
     Transport Layer  : Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
     Internet Layer   : Internet Protocol (IP)
     Network Access   : Ethernet   
<h3>03.3.4 TCP/IP Protocol Suite</h3>
        TCP/IP is: 
         - an open standard protocol suite that is freely available to the public and can be used by any vendor
         - a standards-based protocol suite that is endorsed by the networking and approved by a standards organization to ensure interoperability

        <b>Application Layer</b>
           - Name System   = DNS
           - Host Config   = DHCPv4; DHCPv6; SLAAC
           - Email         = SMTP; POP3; IMAP
           - File Transfer = FTP; SFTP; TFTP
           - Web Service   = HTTP; HTTPS; REST
        <b>Transport Layer</b>
           - Connection-Oriented = TCP
           - Connectionless      = UDP 
        <b>Internet Layer</b>
           - Internet Protocol  = IPv4; IPv6; NAT
           - Messaging          = ICMPv4; ICMPv6; ICMPv6 ND
           - Routing Protocols  = OSPF; EIGRP; BGP
        <b>Network Access Layer</b>
           - Address Resolution = ARP
           - Data Link Protocol = Ethernet; WLAN          
<h3>03.3.5 TCP/IP Communication Process</h3>
        web server encapsulates message and sends to the client de-encapsulates the information

        Ethernet Frame -> IP Packet -> TCP Segment -> User Data
<h3>03.3.6 Check Understanding of Protocol Suites</h3>
        <b>ICMPv4</b> and <b>ICMPv6</b> provide feedback when errors occur
<h2>03.4 Standards Organizations</h2>
        2 of the largest Standards organizations we will deal with are: IEEE and ICANN
<h3>03.4.1 Open Standards</h3>
        open standards encourage - interoperability, competition, and innovation
        standards organizations are vendor neutral, non-profit, and established to develop and promote the concept of open standards
<h3>03.4.2 Internet Standards</h3>
        IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) - oversses and manages IP address allocation, domain name management, and protocol identifiers for ICANN  
        ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) - Coordinates IP allocation, management of domain names, and assignment of other information 
<h3>03.4.3 Electronic and Communications Standards</h3>

<h3>03.5.1 Benefits of Using a Layered Model</h3>
        allows user to explain and understand how data is handled in a network
        -- OSI Model and TCP/IP Model
<h3>03.5.2 OSI Reference Model</h3>

<h3>03.5.4 OSI and TCP/IP Model Comparison</h3>
        - TCP/IP suite does not specify which protocols to use when transmitting over a physical medium
        - OSI Layer 1 (Physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link) discuss the necessary procesures to access the media and physical means to send data over a network

          <b>OSI</b>                <b>TCP/IP</b>

<h2>03.6 Data Encapsulation</h2>
<h3>03.6.1 Segmenting Messages</h3>
        2 major benefits: 
         - Increase speed - large amounts of data can be sent over the network without tying up the communication link
         - Increase efficiency - only segments which fail to reach the destination need to retransmitted, no the entire data stream
<h3>03.6.2 Sequencing</h3>
         process of numbering data segments so that the message may be reassebled at the destination

         ** TCP is responsible for sequencing the individual segments
<h3>03.6.3 Protocol Data Units</h3>
        Encapsulation = process where protocols add their information to the data 

        PDUs passing down the stack are: 
           1) Data (Data Stream)
           2) Segment
           3) Packet
           4) Frame
           5) Bits (Bit Stream)

    in the example we send an email at top layer; as we travel through the model each layer adds a header to the data
        Email data is typed and ready to send     == 1) Data (Data Stream)
        Segment (2) adds 'Transport Header'       == 2) Segment
        Packet (3) adds 'Network Header'          == 3) Packet
        Frame (4) adds 'Frame Header' & 'Trailer' == 4) Frame
        data streams as bits (5)                  == 5) Bits (Bit Stream)
<h3>03.6.4 Encapsulation Example</h3>
        Encapsulation is a top-down process
          the level above does its process and then passes it down to the next level of the model 
             this process is repeated by each layer until it is sent out as a bit stream
<h3>03.6.5 De-encapsulation Example</h3>
        data is de-encapsulated as it moves up the stack
<h3>03.6.6 Check Understanding of Data Encapsulation</h3>

<h2>03.7 Data Access</h2>
<h3>03.7.1 Addresses</h3>
        - Network Layer Source and Destination Addresses   - responsible for delivering the IP packet from source to destination
        - Data Link Layer Source and Destination Addresses - Responsible for delivering data link frame from one NIC to another NIC on the same Network
<h3>03.7.2 Layer 3 Logical Address</h3>
        IP packet contains 2 IP addresses: 
          - Source IP      == IP of the sender
          - Destination IP == IP of the receiving device

       IP addresses have a Host Portion and a Network Portion 
         - network portion is the left-most part of the address
         - host portion is the remaining part of the address and identifies a specific device with the group
<h3>03.7.3 Devices on the Same Network</h3>
        Data Link Layer == Destination, then source
        Network Layer   == Source, then destination
         -devices on the same network will have the same numbers in the 'network' portion of the address
          ex: PC1 = 192.168.1.110  
              FTP = 192.168.1.9    

         both PC1 and FTP are part of the same network -- 192.168.1  
<h3>03.7.4 Role of the Data Link Layer Addresses: Same IP Network</h3>
        if devices are on the same network, the Data Link frame will use the actual MAC address of the destination NIC

        MAC addresses are physically embedded into the Ethernet NIC and are 'local addressing' 
          - source MAC is that of the originator 
          - destination MAC address will be on the same link as the source ??
          ** source and destination of MAC address changes as it moves across devices
             ** destination and source IP addresses remain the same, but destination and source MAC addresses change as they move to new devices 
<h3>03.7.5 Devices on a Remote Network</h3>
<h3>03.7.6 Role of the Network Layer Addresses</h3>
<h3>03.7.7 Role of the Data Link Layer Addresses: Different IP Networks</h3>

<h2>03.8 Module Practice and Quiz</h2>
<h3>03.8.1 What Did I Learn?</h3>
       <b>The Rules</b>
          - Protocols must have a sender and receiver
          - Common protocols include these requirements: 
              - Message encoding
              - Formatting and encapsulation
       <b>Protocols</b>
          - to send data across the network requires the use of several protocols
          - each protocol has it's own function, format, and rules for communication
       <b>Protocol Suites</b>
          - protocol suite is a group of inter-related protocols
          - TCP/IP is an example
       <b>Standards Organizations</b>        
          - Open standards encourage interoperability, competition, and innovation
       <b>Reference Models</b> 
          - 2 models used in networking are TCP/IP model & OSI model
          - TCP/IP has 4 layers; OSI has 7 layers
       <b>Data Encapsulation</b>
          - the form that a piece of data takes at any layer is called a PDU (Protocol Data Unit)
          - 5 different PDUs in data encapsulation: 
              - Data
              - Segment
              - Packet
              - Frame
              - Bits
       <b>Data Access</b>
          - Network and Data Link Layers provide addressing to move data through the network
          - Layer 3 provides IP addressing  (Network Layer 3)
          - Layer 2 provides MAC addressing (Data Link Layer 2)
          - Layers handle addressing differently depending on whether the source and destination are on the same network, or not
