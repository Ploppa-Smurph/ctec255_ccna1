<h1>CTEC-255 wk 02 CCNA 01 module 03 Protocols and Models</h1>
<pre>
<h2>03.0 Introduction</h2>
<h3>03.0.1 Why take this module?</h3>
<h3>03.0.2 What will I learn to do in this module?</h3>
<h3>03.0.3 Activity - Design a Communications System</h3>

<h2>03.1 The Rules</h2>
<h3>03.1.1 Video - Devices in a Bubble</h3>
        IP  - delivery of packets
        TCP - reliability
<h3>03.1.2 Communications Fundamentals</h3>
        Message Source (sender) - people or electronic device that initiate communication  
        Message Destination (receiver) - receives message and interprets it
        Channel - media pathway over which the message travels
<h3>03.1.3 Communication Protocols</h3>
         communication is governed by protocols
         protocols are the rules that are established and agreed upon in order for communication to occur
<h3>03.1.4 Rule Establishment</h3>
        protocols assure proper formatting
            - An identified sender and receiver
            - Common language and grammer
            - Speed and timing of delivery
            - Confirmation of acknowledgment requirements
<h3>03.1.5 Network Protocol Requirements</h3>
        - message encoding
        - message formatting and encapsulating
        - message size
        - message timing 
        - message delivery options
<h3>03.1.6 Message Encoding</h3>
    Encoding -  process of converting information into another acceptable form for transmission
      Message Source -> Encoder -> Transmitter -> Transmission Medium -> Receiver -> Decoder -> Message Destination
<h3>03.1.7 Message Formatting and Encapsulation</h3>
    Formatting depends on type of message and channel used to deliver message
<h3>03.1.8 Message Size</h3>
     the message is broken down into 'Frames' of smaller size and transmitted that way
       - destination host 'decodes' the received information -- destination host interprets the message
<h3>03.1.9 Message Timing</h3>
    - Flow Control: defines how much information and the speed at which it can be delivered  
    - Response Timeout: specifies how long to wait for response and what action to take if a response timeout occurs
    - Access Method: determines when messages can be sent to avoid 'collision of information'
           - Proactive protocols attempt to prevent collisions
           - Reative protocols establish a recovery method after the collision occurs
<h3>03.1.10 Message Delivery Options</h3>
    - unicast: transmitted to a single end device
    - multicast: sendss to one or more end devices 
    - broadcast: sends to ALL end devices (not available on IPv6)
    - anycast: available on IPv6
<h3>03.1.11 Note about the Node Icon</h3>
    nodes are illustrated as circles throughout the course
<h3>03.1.12 Check Understanding</h3>
    - process of converting information to proper form for transmission? 
      -- encoding
    - step of communication process that is concerened with properly identifying address of sender and receiver?
      -- formatting 
<h2>03.2 Protocols</h2>
<h3>03.2.1 Network Protocol Overview</h3>
       Protocols - rules on how we communicate
       Network Protocols - define a common set of rules that can be implemented on
          - Software
          - Hardware
          - Both
        Protocols have their own:
          - Function
          - Format
          - Rules

      <b>Network Communication Protocol</b> - enable 2 or more devices to communicate over 1 or more networks
      <b>Network Security</b> - secure data to provide authentication, data integrity, and data encryption 
      <b>Routing</b> - enable routers to exchange route information, compare path information and select best path
      <b>Service Discovery</b> - used for automatic detection of devices or services  
<h3>03.2.2 Network Protocol Functions</h3>
      Protocols may have 1 or more functions
       <b>FUNCTION</b>                       <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b><i>Addressing</i></b>             - Identifies sender and receiver
       <b><i>Reliability</i></b>            - Provides guranteed delivery
       <b><i>Flow Control</i></b>           - Ensures data flows at an efficient rate
       <b><i>Sequencing</i></b>             - Uniquely labels each transmitted segment of data 
       <b><i>Error Detection</i></b>        - Determines if data became corrupted during transmission
       <b><i>Application Interface</i></b>  - Process-to-Process communications between network applications
<h3>03.2.3 Protocol Interaction</h3>
    Networks require the use of several protocols each with a unique function and format:

    <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b>  - Governs way web server and web client interact; defines content and format
    <b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</b> - Manages individual conversations; Provides guranteed delivery; Manages flow control
    <b>Internet Protocol (IP)</b>              - Delivers messages globally for the sender to receiver
    <b>Ethernet</b>                            - Delivers messages from 1 NIC to another NIC on the same Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN) 
<h3>03.2.4 Check Understanding of Protocols</h3>
        <b>BGP</b> and <b>OSPF</b> are examples of which type of protocols?
           -- BGP and OSPF are routing protocols, they enable routers to exchange route information to reach remote networks
<h2>03.3 Protocol Suites</h2>
<h3>03.3.1 Network Protocol Suites</h3>
        Network Protocol Suites are inter-related protocols grouped together to perform a communication function

        Protocol Stacks - help visualize how protocols within a suite are implemented
          lower layer protocols are concerned with moving data 
          higher layer protocols are focused on the content of the message being sent
<h3>03.3.2 Evolution of Protocol Suites</h3>
        Internet Protocol Suite = TCP / IP
          most common protocol; maintained by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
        Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) / aka (ISO)
          developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  
        AppleTalk - Proprietary Apple Suite - not really used anymore
        Novell NetWare - Proprietary Suite from Novell - not very common
        
        the TCP/IP Layer: 
            Application Layer of TCP/IP   = HTTP, DNS, DHCP, FTP
            Transport Layer of TCP/IP     = TCP, UDP
            Internet Layer of TCP/IP      = IPv4 & IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6 
            Network Access Layer          = Ethernet, ARP, WLAN
