    <i>Issue the ping command without specifying a destination IP address.</i>    
    
<b>41) Users are complaining that they are unable to browse certain websites on the Internet. An administrator can successfully ping a web server via its IP address, but cannot browse to the

    <i>nslookup</i>
    
<b>42) Which statement is true about Cisco IOS ping indicators?</b>

<b>43) Refer to the exhibit. Baseline documentation for a small company had ping round trip time statistics of 36/97/132 between hosts H1 and H3. Today the network administrator checked connectivity by pinging between hosts H1 and H3 that resulted in a round trip time of 1458/2390/6066. What does this indicate to the network administrator?</b>
