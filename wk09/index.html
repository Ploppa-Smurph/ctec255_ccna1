<h2>Review Questions</h2>
<b>01) A teacher is having difficulties connecting his PC to the classroom network. He needs to verify that a default gateway is configured correctly. What is the best command to use to accomplish the task?</b>
    <i>ipconfig</i>

<b>02) Which attack involves a compromise of data that occurs between two end points?</b>
    <i>man-in-the-middle attack</i>
   
<b>03) Match the type of information security threat to the scenario. (Not all options are used.)</b>
    <i>information theft  - obtain trade secrets 
       identity theft     - pretend to be someone else by using stolen personal information
       data loss          - install virus code to destroy recording 
       disruption service - prevent users from accessing a website by sending large number of links   </i>
    
<b>04) What feature of SSH makes it more secure than Telnet for a device management connection?</b>
    <i>login information and data encryption</i>
    
<b>05) Match the description to the type of firewall filtering. (Not all options are used.)</b>
    <i>Stateful Packet Inspection - based on whether traffic is in response to request from internal host
       URL filtering              - based on web address or keyword
       application filtering      - based on port numbers
       packet filtering           - based on mac / ip address    </i>
    
<b>06) What is the purpose of the network security authentication function?</b>
    <i>require users to prove who they are</i>
    
<b>07) Match each weakness with an example. (Not all options are used.)</b>
    <i>technological weakness    - examine os of network device for vulnerabilities 
       configuration weakness    - network engineer did not filter a type of malicious traffic.
       security policy weakeness - did not consider implications or unauthorized users</i>
    
<b>08) What is the role of an IPS?</b>
    <i>detecting and blocking of attacks in realtime</i>

<b>09) What is the advantage of using SSH over Telnet?</b>    
    <i>ssh provides secure communication</i>

<b>10) What is the difference between a virus and a worm?</b>
    <i>worms self-replicate but viruses do not</i>
    
<b>11) Which firewall feature is used to ensure that packets coming into a network are legitimate responses to requests initiated from internal hosts?</b>    
    <i>stateful packet inspection</i>
    
<b>12) A user is redesigning a network for a small company and wants to ensure security at a reasonable price. The user deploys a new application-aware 
       firewall with intrusion detection capabilities on the ISP connection. The user installs a second firewall to separate the company network from 
       the public network. Additionally, the user installs an IPS on the internal network of the company. What approach is the user implementing?</b>
    <i>layered</i>
    
<b>13) An administrator decides to use "WhatAreyouwaiting4" as the password on a newly installed router. Which statement applies to the password choice?</b>
    <i>it is strong because it uses a passphrase</i>
    
<b>14) Which statement describes the ping and tracert commands?</b>
    <i>tracert uses each hop, while ping shows a destination reply only</i>
    
<b>15) A technician is to document the current configurations of all network devices in a college, including those in off-site buildings. Which protocol 
       would be best to use to securely access the network devices?</b>
    <i>ssh</i>

<b>16) What is considered the most effective way to mitigate a worm attack?</b>
    <i>Download security updates from the operating system vendor and patch all vulnerable systems.</i>    
    
<b>17) On which two interfaces or ports can security be improved by configuring executive timeouts? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>console ports, vty ports</i>
    
<b>18) PT activity - Which command has to be configured on the router to complete the SSH configuration?</b>
    <i>transport input ssh</i>
    
<b>19) When configuring SSH on a router to implement secure network management, a network engineer has issued the login local and transport input 
       ssh line vty commands. What three additional configuration actions have to be performed to complete the SSH configuration? (Choose three.)</b>
    <i>Generate the asymmetric RSA keys, Configure the correct IP domain name, Create a valid local username and password database.</i>
    
<b>20) Which network service automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network?</b>
    <i>DHCP</i>

<b>21) By following a structured troubleshooting approach, a network administrator identified a network issue after a conversation with the user. 
      What is the next step that the administrator should take?</b>
    <i>establish a theory or probable causes</i>
    
<b>22) A user reports a lack of network connectivity. The technician takes control of the user machine and attempts to ping other computers on the 
      network and these pings fail. The technician pings the default gateway and that also fails. What can be determined for sure by the results of these tests?</b>
    <i>nothing can be determined for sure at this point</i>
    
<b>23> A network engineer is analyzing reports from a recently performed network baseline. Which situation would depict a possible latency issue?</b>
    <i>an increase in host-to-host ping response times</i>

<b>24) A network administrator is upgrading a small business network to give high priority to real-time applications traffic. What two types of network services 
      is the network administrator trying to accommodate? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>voice, video</i>
    
<b>25) Why would a network administrator use the tracert utility?</b>
    <i>to identify where a packet was lost or delayed on a network </i>
    
<b>26) What is the purpose of a small company using a protocol analyzer utility to capture network traffic on the network segments where the company is considering a network upgrade?</b>
    <i>to document and analyze network traffic requirements on each network segment</i>
