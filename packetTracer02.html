<h1>Cisco Packet Tracer 02: Exploring Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer</h1>
<pre>
<h2>Module 1: Set Up Your Small Office Network</h2>    
<h3>1.0 Introduction</h3>
<h4>1.0.1 Welcome to Exploring Networking with Cisco Packet Manager</h4>
<h4>1.0.2 First Time in the Course</h4>
<h4>1.0.3 Why Should I Take this Course</h4>
<h3>1.1 Connect Devices using Wireless Technologies</h3>
<h4>1.1.1 Video - Topology Overview</h4>
    Packet Tracer's 'Physical' view allows us to see devices in homes or offices 
      we can also zoom in on wiring and cabling of devices 
<h4>1.1.2 Structured Cabling</h4>
    in packet tracer 'Physical' mode we will organize cabling, wall plates, bendpoints, and cable color
<h4>1.1.3 Video - Structured Cabling in the Physical Workspace and Cabling Devices in a Rack</h4>
    there are copper patch panels and wall mounts available in packet tracer
    also, fiber patch panels and wall mounts available

    create 'bendpoints' to organize the cable so it doesn't run across desktops
<h4>1.1.4 Packet Tracer - Create Realistic Structured Cabling in the Physical Workspace and Cabling Devices in a Rack</h4>
    packet tracer Activity
    - Part 1: Install a Patch Panel in the Wiring Closet
    - Part 2: Attach a Wall Mount in the Office
    - Part 3: Connect an Additional Wall Mount and Cables
<h4>1.1.5 Connect Devices using Wired and Wireless Technologies</h4>
    Wifi
    bluetooth
    cellular
<h4>1.1.6 Packet Tracer - Connect Devices using Wireless Technologies</h4>
    packet tracer Activity
     - Part 1: Connect a Laptop to the Office WLAN
     - Part 2: Connect Devices with Bluetooth Technology
     - Part 3: Tether a Laptop to use a Cellular Network via the Smartphone
<h4>1.1.7 Video Explore Device Configuration Using the CLI (console)</h4>
        configuring devices from the CLI using Cisco's Internetwork Operating System

     router and switches use CLI often -- 
     device opens in 'User Exec' mode 
       'enable'              = enter privilage mode   
       '?'                   = get list of commands available in current mode
       'configure terminal'  = enter configuration mode to make configuration changes to the device
       'end'                 = leave configuration mode
           after making any configuration changes you MUST save the changes for the next startup
       'copy running-config startup-config'  
<h4>1.1.8 Packet Tracer - Explore Device Configuration Using the CLI (console)</h4>
        - Part 1: Connect to the Device Using a Console Connection
        - Part 2: Copy Configuration Information to the Device
        - Part 3: Save the Updated Configuration to the Device
<h2>Module 2: Manage and Monitor Your Branch Office Network</h2>    
<h3>2.0 Structured Wiring / PT Simulation</h3>
<h4>2.0.1 Packet Tracer Simulation Mode</h4>
        in simulation mode you can slow the data traffic down and observe 1 packet at a time
      ** capturing and viewing PDU's can be used to verify connectivity, functionality, and troubleshoot issues.
        -- captured PDU's can be viewed in OSI Model mode
<h4>2.0.2 Video - Packet Tracer Network Simulation Mode</h4>
        realtime mode - traffic moves quickly
        simulation mode - can slow down time to see the packet move from location to location
         
        can filter and view only packets that you want to view

       on toolbar you can 'Create Complex PDU' 
<h4>2.0.3 Packet Tracer - Examine Packets in the Small Office</h4>
    Packet Tracer activity
        - Part 1: Create a Simple PDU in Simulation Mode
        - Part 2: View Contents of PDUs
        - Part 3: Create a Complex PDU in Simulation Mode

<h4>2.0.4 Video - Create, Arrange, Uncluster, Delete, and Connect Clusters</h4>

<h4>2.0.5 Edit and Annotate a Topology</h4>

<h4>2.0.6 Video - Edit and Annotate a Topology</h4>

<h4>2.0.7 Packet Tracer - Edit Toplogies</h4>

<h3>2.1 Network Controller</h3>
