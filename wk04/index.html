<h2>06 - Data Link Layer (Layer 02 OSI model)</h2>    
<h3>6.1 - Purpose of Data Link Layer</h3>
<h4>Purpose of Data Link Layer</h4>
    2 parts: LLC (Logical Link Control) -- deals with upper layers
             MAC layer                  -- deals with layer 1 (physical layer)
     Data Link Layer - responsible for communication between end-device NIC (network interface card)
                     - allows upper layer protocols access to physical media
                     - <b><i>encapsulates</i></b> Layer 3 packets (IPv4 and IPv6) into Layer 2 'Frames'
                     - performs error detection and rejects corrupt frames    
    Layer 2 Headers have <i>Destination</i> then <i>Source</i>
    Layer 3 Headers have <i>Source IP</i> then <i>Destination IP</i> 
<h4>IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Data Link Sublayers</h4>
    LLC Sublayer - 802.2
    Ethernet     - 802.3   - ethernet standards
    WLAN         - 802.11  - wireless standards 
    WPAN         - 802.15  - personal area standards (Bluetooth, RFID)

   Data Link Layer consists of 2 sublayers 
     - LLC (Logical Link Control) - communicates between networking software, at upper layers, and device hardware, at lowest layers
     - MAC (Media Access Control) - handles data encapsulation and media access control 
<h4>Providing Access to Media</h4>
    Router performs four basic layer 2 functions at each hop:
     - Accepts a frame from the network medium
     - De-encapsulates the frame to expose the encapsulated packet.
     - Re-encapsulates the packet into a new frame.
     - Forwards the new frame on the medium of the next network segment

     ** packets exchanged between nodes may experience many data link layer (layer 2) and media transitions **
          *** the MAC destination and source information changes at each hop; the IP Source and Destination information will remain the same throughout ***
<h4>Data Link Layer Standards</h4>
     - IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronic Enginieers)
     - ITU (International Telecommunications Union)
     - ISO (International Organizations for Standardization)
     - ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
<h3>6.02 - Topologies</h3>     
<h4>Physical and Logical Topologies</h4>
     Topology = arrangement and relationship of devices and interconnections between them.
     - <b>Physical Topology</b> - shows physical connections and how devices are interconnected
     - <b>Logical Topology</b> - identifies virtual connections between devices using device interfaces and IP addressing schemes
<h4>LAN / WAN Topologies</h4>
    - Point-to-Point (p2p) - simplest and most common. permanent link between endpoints
    - Hub and Spoke - similar to star; central site interconnects branch sites through point-to-point links
    - Mesh - provides high availability but requires every end system to be connected to every other end system.
<h4>Point-to-Point</h4>
     physical p2p connects 2 nodes. 
      all data can only travel to or from the 2 nodes
<h4>LAN Topologies</h4>
     - Star Topology - 
     - Extended Star -
     - Bus Topology - legacy, requires terminators / reflection points to keep signal from bouncing back and forth on the line
     - Ring Topology -
<h4>Half and Full Duplex Communication</h4> 
    - Half Duplex = only 1 device can send or receive at a time (ex: like a walkie-talkie)

    - Full Duplex = both devices simultaneously transmit and receive
         -- ethernet switches operate in full-duplex mode.
<h4>Access Control Methods</h4>         
    - <b>Contention-based Access</b>
       - All nodes operate half-duplex
      ex: 1) CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access with collision detection) - used on legacy bus-topology Ethernet
          2) CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) - used on Wireless LANs

    - <b>Controlled Access</b>
         - Deterministic access where each node has its own time on the medium
         - Used on legacy networks such as Token Ring and ARCNET
<h4>Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CD</h4>         
    - used by legacy Ethernet LANs
    - operates half-duplex (only 1 device sends or receives at a time)
    - collision detection governs when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time

   <b>CSMA/CD collision detection process:</b>
    1) devices transmitting simultaneously will result in a signal collision on the shared media
    2) devices detect collision
    3) devices wait a random period of time before retransmitting data
<h4>Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CA</h4>    
    - used by IEEE 802.11 WLANs
    - operates half-duplex
    - uses collision avoidance process to govern when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time

    <b>CSMA/CA collision avoidance process:</b>
    1) when transmitting, devices include time duration needed for the transmission
    2) all devices on shared medium receive time duration information and know how long the medium will be unavailable.
<h3>6.03 - Link Frame</h3>
<h4>The Frame</h4>   
     data is encapsulated by the data link layer (layer 2) with a header and trailer to form a frame.
      - header 
      - data 
      - trailer

      ** the fields of the header and trailer vary depending on the layer protocol

      the amount of control information carried in the frame varies according to access control information and logical topology
