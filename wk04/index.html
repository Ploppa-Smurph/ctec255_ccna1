<h2>06 - Data Link Layer (Layer 02 OSI model)</h2>    
<h3>6.1 - Purpose of Data Link Layer</h3>
<h4>Purpose of Data Link Layer</h4>
    2 parts: LLC (Logical Link Control) -- deals with upper layers
             MAC layer                  -- deals with layer 1 (physical layer)
     Data Link Layer - responsible for communication between end-device NIC (network interface card)
                     - allows upper layer protocols access to physical media
                     - <b><i>encapsulates</i></b> Layer 3 packets (IPv4 and IPv6) into Layer 2 'Frames'
                     - performs error detection and rejects corrupt frames    
    Layer 2 Headers have <i>Destination</i> then <i>Source</i>
    Layer 3 Headers have <i>Source IP</i> then <i>Destination IP</i> 
<h4>IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Data Link Sublayers</h4>
    LLC Sublayer - 802.2
    Ethernet     - 802.3   - ethernet standards
    WLAN         - 802.11  - wireless standards 
    WPAN         - 802.15  - personal area standards (Bluetooth, RFID)

   Data Link Layer consists of 2 sublayers 
     - LLC (Logical Link Control) - communicates between networking software, at upper layers, and device hardware, at lowest layers
     - MAC (Media Access Control) - handles data encapsulation and media access control 
<h4>Providing Access to Media</h4>
    Router performs four basic layer 2 functions at each hop:
     - Accepts a frame from the network medium
     - De-encapsulates the frame to expose the encapsulated packet.
     - Re-encapsulates the packet into a new frame.
     - Forwards the new frame on the medium of the next network segment

     ** packets exchanged between nodes may experience many data link layer (layer 2) and media transitions **
          *** the MAC destination and source information changes at each hop; the IP Source and Destination information will remain the same throughout ***
<h4>Data Link Layer Standards</h4>
     - IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronic Enginieers)
     - ITU (International Telecommunications Union)
     - ISO (International Organizations for Standardization)
     - ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
<h3>6.02 - Topologies</h3>     
<h4>Physical and Logical Topologies</h4>
     Topology = arrangement and relationship of devices and interconnections between them.
     - <b>Physical Topology</b> - shows physical connections and how devices are interconnected
     - <b>Logical Topology</b> - identifies virtual connections between devices using device interfaces and IP addressing schemes
<h4>LAN / WAN Topologies</h4>
    - Point-to-Point (p2p) - simplest and most common. permanent link between endpoints
    - Hub and Spoke - similar to star; central site interconnects branch sites through point-to-point links
    - Mesh - provides high availability but requires every end system to be connected to every other end system.
<h4>Point-to-Point</h4>
     physical p2p connects 2 nodes. 
      all data can only travel to or from the 2 nodes
<h4>LAN Topologies</h4>
     - Star Topology - 
     - Extended Star -
     - Bus Topology - legacy, requires terminators / reflection points to keep signal from bouncing back and forth on the line
     - Ring Topology -
<h4>Half and Full Duplex Communication</h4> 
    - Half Duplex = only 1 device can send or receive at a time (ex: like a walkie-talkie)

    - Full Duplex = both devices simultaneously transmit and receive
         -- ethernet switches operate in full-duplex mode.
<h4>Access Control Methods</h4>         
    - <b>Contention-based Access</b>
       - All nodes operate half-duplex
      ex: 1) CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access with collision detection) - used on legacy bus-topology Ethernet
          2) CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) - used on Wireless LANs

    - <b>Controlled Access</b>
         - Deterministic access where each node has its own time on the medium
         - Used on legacy networks such as Token Ring and ARCNET
<h4>Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CD</h4>         
    - used by legacy Ethernet LANs
    - operates half-duplex (only 1 device sends or receives at a time)
    - collision detection governs when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time

   <b>CSMA/CD collision detection process:</b>
    1) devices transmitting simultaneously will result in a signal collision on the shared media
    2) devices detect collision
    3) devices wait a random period of time before retransmitting data
<h4>Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CA</h4>    
    - used by IEEE 802.11 WLANs
    - operates half-duplex
    - uses collision avoidance process to govern when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time

    <b>CSMA/CA collision avoidance process:</b>
    1) when transmitting, devices include time duration needed for the transmission
    2) all devices on shared medium receive time duration information and know how long the medium will be unavailable.
<h3>6.03 - Link Frame</h3>
<h4>The Frame</h4>   
     data is encapsulated by the data link layer (layer 2) with a header and trailer to form a frame.
      - header 
      - data 
      - trailer

      ** the fields of the header and trailer vary depending on the layer protocol

      the amount of control information carried in the frame varies according to access control information and logical topology
<h4>Frame Fields</h4>
     <b>Header</b>  - <i>Frame Start</i> - identifies beginning of frame
                    - <i>Addressing</i> - indicates source and destination nodes
                    - <i>Type</i> - identifies encapsulated Layer 3 protocol
                    - <i>Control</i> - identifies flow control service
     
     <b>Trailer</b> - <i>Error Detection</i> - used to determine transmission errors               
                    - <i>Frame Stop</i> - identifies end of frame
<h4>Layer 2 Addresses</h4>
     aka 'Physical Address' -- layer 2 address information is contained in the frame header.
      -- used for local delivery of a frame on the link. 

    Layer 2 address is updated by each device that forwards the frame.
      
    Destination NIC (Physical Address) -> Source NIC (Physical Address) -- the MAC information changes each time the frame is handed off
      ** the layer 3 IP information stays the same throughout the transmission (Source IP -> Destination IP) 
<h4>LAN and WAN Frames</h4>
      Logical Topology and Physical Media determine the data link protocol used: 
         - Ethernet
         - 802.11 Wireless
         - Point-to-Point (p2p; PPP)
         - High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
         - Frame-Relay

<h2>07 - Ethernet Switching</h2>    
      Ethernet Switches that rely on MAC addresses and MAC address tables are Layer 2 switches - physical layer switches
<h3>7.1 - Ethernet Frames</h3>
<h4>Ethernet Encapsulation</h4>
     Ethernet operates in the data link and physical layer (Layer 2; Layer 1)

     defined by the IEEE 802.2 & 802.3 standards 

     802.2 = Local Logical Control sublayer of Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
     802.3 = MAC and Physical Layer (MAC sublayer of Layer 2 and Layer 1 [physical layer])
<h4>Data Link Sublayers</h4>
      Ethernet uses 2 sublayers of the Data Link Layer (layer 2 of OSI)
        LLC (Local Logical Control) - IEEE 802.2 - places information in the frame to identify which network layer protocol is used for the frame 

        MAC (Media Access Control) - responsible for data encapsulation and media access control; provides data link layer addressing

        802.2 = Ethernet; FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, etc... 
        802.11 = Wireless, wireless standards, 802.11a; 802.11g, etc.. 
        802.15 = WPAN (personal network); Bluetooth, RFID, etc... 
<h4>MAC Sublayer</h4>
     responsible for data encapsulation and accessing the media

    <b>Data Encapsulation</b> 
        IEEE 802.3 data encapsulation includes: 
         - <b><i>Ethernet Frame</i></b> - internal structure of Ethernet Frame
         - <b><i>Ethernet Addressing</i></b> - includes the destination and source MAC to deliver Ethernet frame from Ethernet NIC to Ethernet NIC on the same LAN
         - <b><i>Ethernet Error Detection</i></b> - Ethernet frame includes a frame check sequence (FCS) trailer used for error detection

    <b>Media Access</b> - the IEEE 802.3 MAC sublayer includes specifications for different Ethernet communications standards over various types of media including copper and fiber.
       Legacy Ethernet using BUS topology or hubs, are shared, half-duplex. 
       
       Ethernet over half-duplex uses 'contention-based' access method;
         utilizes <b><i>CSMA/CD</i></b> -- collision detection 

       Modern LANs use switches which operate full-duplex and do not require CSMA/CD

       802.3u = Fast Ethernet
       802.3z = Gigabit over Fiber
       802.3ab = Gigabit over Copper
       802.3ae = 10 Gigabit over Fiber
        those are the common standards
<h4>Ethernet Frame Fields</h4>
     minimum Ethernet Frame size = 64 bytes
     maximum Ethernet frame size = 1518 bytes 
       ** 'Preamble' size is not included when describing the size of the frame. **  

     - any frame less than 64 bytes is considered a 'Collision Fragment' / 'Runt Frame' and is automatically discarded.
     - Frames more than 1500 bytes are considered 'jumbo' / 'baby giant frames'

     <b>Ethernet Frame Composition:</b>
      1) Preamble = 8 bytes; does not count toward Frame size
      2) Destination MAC = 6 bytes; destination address
      3) Source MAC = 6 bytes; source address
      4) Type / Length = 2 bytes; Type of frame, Length of frame
      5) Data = 45 - 1500 bytes; data packet / payload
      6) FCS = 4 bytes; error correction
<h3>7.2 - MAC Address (Media Access Control)</h3>
            a 48-bit binary value expressed using 12 hexadecimal values
                - given that 8-bits (1 byte) is a common binary grouping, this can be represented in hexadecimal in the range 00 to FF
                 -- use the leading 0 when expressing hex MAC addresses
                 -- hex numbers are often represented with '0x' preceeding the value. ex: 0x73; this denotes the value is hexadecimal (not decimal)
                   -- hex can also be denoted by subscript 16, or 'H' following the value. ex: 73H to specify a hexvalue
<h4>Ethernet MAC Address</h4>
   MAC address is 48-bits / 6 bytes in length.

   Organizational Unique Identifier - 1st 3 bytes of MAC address; all NIC connected devices from a manufacturer will have the same 3 byte OUI (eg: MSI will have their own, Apple will have a unique #, Sony will all have the same OUI, etc...)

   Vendor Assigned - 2nd 3 bytes of MAC address; each device has a unique value here, the vendor OUI will be the same, the Assigned value will be unique per device.
<h4>Frame Processing</h4>
    when a device forwards a message to an Ethernet network the Ethernet header must include the 'Destination' MAC address and the 'Source' MAC address
    
    when a NIC receives an Ethernet frame, it examine the destination MAC address to see if it matches the physical MAC address stored in RAM
      - if there is a match to a MAC address stored in RAM, then the device passes the frame up the OSI layers wher de-encapsulation takes place

    Workstations, Servers, Printers, Mobile Devices, Routers, and more all have MAC addresses assigned by Ethernet NIC
