<h2>1.2 Network Components</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 Host Roles</h3>
    email server 
    web server
    file server

    clients request information from Hosts/servers
<h3>1.2.2 Peer-to-Peer</h3>
    small networking setup == not as scalable, not as secure

    easier to setup, but not as centralized
<h3>1.2.3 End Devices</h3>
    client machines, smart tv
    smartphones, tablets
    laptops and pcs
<h3>1.2.4 Intermediary Devices</h3>
    devices you connect through -- connects end devices

    router
    LAN switch - layer 2 switch
    Multilayer switch - layer 3 switch
    Firewall
    

    management of data as it flows through a network is the role of the intermediary device
     - Regenerate and retransmit data signals
     - Maintain information about what pathways exist in the network
     - Notify other devices of errors and communication failures

<h2>1.4 Common Types of Networks</h2>
<h3>1.4.1 Networks of Many Sizes</h3>
        Small Home - connects a few devices to the internet 
        Small Office / Home Office - computer within home to connect to corporate office
        Medium to Large Network - many locations with hundreds of interconnected computers
        World Wide Network - hundreds of millions of computers; ie: the internet 
<h3>1.4.2 LANs and WANs</h3>
        PAN (Personal Area Network) - bluetooth connected personal devices used on your person or in a small area 

        LAN (Local Area Network) - connects end devices in a limited area
                                   ie: single floor of office building, \
                                   ie02: a lab at school 

        CAN (Campus Area Network)  - multiple buildings and networks all joined into a larger network

        MAN (Multiple Area Network) - ie: police or fire department; many different networks connected through a city

        WAN (Wide Area Network)  - interconnects LANs over wider geographic areas
                                     ie: large company, google 
<h3>1.4.3 the Internet</h3>
        a worldwide collection of interconnected LANs and WANs 

        LANs are connected to each other using WANs

        3 main groups help keep internet structure: 
            - IETF
            - ICANN
            - IAB
<h3>1.4.4 Intranets and Extranets</h3>
        Intranet = internal business network
        Extranet = Suppliers, Customers, Collaborators; offers secure access to business
        Internet = worldwide access -- capital I = world wide web
<h3>1.4.5 Check Your Understanding</h3>

<h2>1.5 Internet Connections</h2>
<h3>1.5.1 Internet Access Technologies</h3>
        Cellular
        Satelite
        DSL
        Cable
        Fiber
<h3>1.5.2 Home and Small Office Internet Connections</h3>
        cable     - high bandwidth, always on, provided by cable provider
        DSL       - high bandwidth, always on, runs over telephone line
        Cellular  - cell phone network to connect to internet 
        Satellite - great for rural areas without much coverage
        Dial-up   - low bandwidth, over telephone line  
<h3>1.5.3 Business and Internet Connections</h3>
        Dedicated Lease Line - ex: T1 or T2 connection, very high speed
                                        private voice and data line
        Ethernet WAN         - extends LAN into the WAN
        DSL                  - business level DSL, including SDSL (Symmetric Digital Subscriber Lines)
        Satellite            - can provide connection when wired solutions are unavailable
<h3>1.5.4 the Converging Network</h3>
        has multiple services in 1 network:  - data
                                             - voice
                                             - video
<h3>1.5.5 Packet Tracer - Network Representation</h3>

<h2>1.6 Reliable Networks</h2>
<h3>1.6.1 Network Architecture</h3>
        technologies that support the infrastructure 

        4 Characteristics of a Reliable Network:
          - Fault Tolerance
          - Scalability
          - Quaility of Service
          - Security
<h3>1.6.2 Fault Tolerance</h3>
        limit the impact of failure by having multiple paths 

        provide redundancy by packet switching: 
            - packet switching splits traffic into packets that are routed over a network
            - each packet can (theoretically) take a different path and end at the correct destination 

        packet switched is the opposite of circuit-switched network    
<h3>1.6.3 Scalability</h3>
        allows for expansion and quickly updating needs without impacting performance
<h3>1.6.4 Quality of Service</h3>
        router manages flow of data and voice traffic to keep it from being jittery or lagging
<h3>1.6.5 Network Security</h3>
     SSH is more secure than Telnet, but it is hackable
        2 main types of security: 
            Network Infrastructure Security-
                - Physical Security of network devices
                - Preventing unauthorized access to devices and secure areas
            Information Security:
                - Protection of data while transmitted over the network
        3 goals of network security:
            - Confidentiality - only intended recipient can read data 
            - Integrity       - data is unaltered and matches the data from the source 
            - Availability    - assurance of timely and reliable access to data
