<h2>Exam Review</h2>
<b>Which term describes a field in the IPv4 packet header that contains a unicast, multicast, or broadcast address?</b>
    <i>Destination IPv4</i>

<b>What is the aim of an ARP spoofing attack?</b>
    <i>to associate IP addresses to the wrong MAC address</i>
    
<b>What statement describes the function of the Address Resolution Protocol?</b>
    <i>ARP is used to discover the MAC address of any host on the local network.</i>

<b>Which destination address is used in an ARP request frame?</b>
    <i>FFFF.FFFF.FFFF</i>

<b>What important information is examined in the Ethernet frame header by a Layer 2 device in order to forward the data onward?</b>
    <i>Destination MAC Address</i>

<b>Which two types of IPv6 messages are used in place of ARP for address resolution?</b>
    <i>Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement</i>

<b>What property of ARP allows hosts on a LAN to send traffic to remote networks?</b>
    <i>Local hosts learn the MAC address of the default gateway.</i>

<b>What is the effect of using the Router# copy running-config startup-config command on a router?</b>
    <i>Contents of NVRAM will change</i>

<b>What are two potential network problems that can result from ARP operation? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>On large networks with low bandwidth, multiple ARP broadcasts could cause data communication delays.

        Network attackers could manipulate MAC address and IP address mappings in ARP messages with the intent of intercepting network traffic.</i>

<b>What will happen if the default gateway address is incorrectly configured on a host?</b>
    <i>The host cannot communicate with hosts in other networks.</i>

<b>Why is NAT not needed in IPv6?​</b>
    <i>Any host or user can get a public IPv6 network address because the number of available IPv6 addresses is extremely large.​</i>

<b>Which field in the IPv4 header is used to prevent a packet from traversing a network endlessly?</b>
    <i>Time-To-Live</i>

<b>Within a production network, what is the purpose of configuring a switch with a default gateway address?</b>
    <i>The default gateway address is used to forward packets originating from the switch to remote networks.</i>

<b>What IPv4 header field identifies the upper layer protocol carried in the packet?</b>
    <i>Protocol</i>

<b>When transporting data from real-time applications, such as streaming audio and video, which field in the IPv6 header can be used to inform the routers and switches to maintain the same path for the packets in the same conversation?</b>
    <i>Flow Label</i>

<b>Which parameter does the router use to choose the path to the destination when there are multiple routes available?</b>
    <i>The lower metric value that is associated with the destination network</i>

<b>A computer can access devices on the same network but cannot access devices on other networks. What is the probable cause of this problem?</b>
    <i>The computer has an invalid default gateway address.</i>

<b>How do hosts ensure that their packets are directed to the correct network destination?</b>
    <i>They have to keep their own local routing table that contains a route to the loopback interface, a local network route, and a remote default route.​</i>

<b>What routing table entry has a next hop address associated with a destination network?</b>
    <i>Remote Routes</i>

<b>A new network administrator has been asked to enter a banner message on a Cisco device. What is the fastest way a network administrator could test whether the banner is properly configured?</b>
    <i>Exit Privileged Exec mode and press enter</i>

<b>What happens when the transport input ssh command is entered on the switch vty lines?</b>
    <i>Communication between the switch and remote users is encrypted.</i>

<b>The global configuration command ip default-gateway 172.16.100.1 is applied to a switch. What is the effect of this command?</b>
    <i>The switch can be remotely managed from a host on another network</i>

<b>What are two functions of NVRAM? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>to store the startup configuration file

        to retain contents when power is removed</i>

<b>Which three commands are used to set up secure access to a router through a connection to the console interface? (Choose three.)</b>
    <i>password cisco; login; line console 0</i>

<b>The exhibit shows a small switched network and the contents of the MAC address table of the switch. PC1 has sent a frame addressed to PC3. What will the switch do with the frame?</b>
    <i>The switch will forward the frame to all ports except port 4.</i>

<b>PC1 attempts to connect to File_server1 and sends an ARP request to obtain a destination MAC address. Which MAC address will PC1 receive in the ARP reply?</b>
    <i>the MAC address of the G0/0 interface on R1</i>

<b>Match Commands to correct actions:</b>    
    <i>Router(config)# hostname CL1</i> <i>configures a name on the router</i>
    NOT <i>router(config)# enable password Cisco</i>
    <i>Router(config)# banner motd #</i> <i>displays a message wwhen the router is accessed</i> 
 
<b>A network admin requires access to manage routers and switches</b>    
    <i>SSH</i> <i>remote access method that uses encryption</i>    
    <i>console</i> <i>preferred out-of-band access method</i>    
    <i>AUX</i> <i>remote access via a dialup connection</i>    
    <i>Telent</i> <i>unsecure remote access</i>    

<b>Match command with device mode at which command is entered:</b>    
    <i>login</i> <i>R1(config-line)#</i>
    <i>service password-encryption</i> <i>R1(config)#</i>
    <i>ip address 192.168.4.4 255.2555.255.0</i> <i>R1(config-if)#</i>
    <i>copy running-config startup-config</i> <i>R1#</i>
    <i>enable</i> <i>R1></i>    

<b>Consider the IP address configuration shown from PC1. What is a description of the default gateway address?</b>    
    <i>It is the IP address of the Router1 interface that connects the PC1 LAN to Router1</i>    

<b>Perform the tasks in the activity instructions and then answer the question. Which interfaces in each router are active and operational?</b>    
    <i>R1: G0/0 and S0/0/0
       R2: G0/1 and S0/0/0</i>

<b>A network administrator is connecting a new host to the Store LAN. The host needs to communicate with remote networks. What IP address would be configured as the default gateway on the new host?</b>
    <i>172.19.98.230</i>  

<b>A user PC has successfully transmitted packets to www.cisco.com. Which IP address does the user PC target in order to forward its data off the local network?</b>
    <i>172.20.0.254</i>    

<b>Which two functions are primary functions of a router? (Choose two.)</b>    
    <i>packet forwarding; path selection</i>    

<b>Which term describes a field in the IPv4 packet header that contains a 32-bit binary value associated with an interface on the sending device?</b>    
    <i>source IPv4 address</i>
    
<b>Which statement describes a feature of the IP protocol?</b>
    <i>IP relies on upper layer services to handle situations of missing or out-of-order packets.</i>    

<b>What is a basic characteristic of the IP protocol?</b>
    <i>connectionless</i>    

<b>What are two services provided by the OSI network layer? (Choose two.)</b>    
    <i>routing packets toward the destination
