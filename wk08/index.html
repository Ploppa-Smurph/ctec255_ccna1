<pre>
<h2>Module 14: Transport Layer</h2>
<h2>Module 15: Application Layer</h2>
<h2>Module: 14 Transport Layer & 15: Application Layer Test</h2>
<b>01) A client creates a packet to send to a server. The client is requesting TFTP service. What number will be used as the destination port number in the sending packet?</b>
    <i>69 </i>

<b>02) What is a key characteristic of the peer-to-peer networking model?</b>
    <i>Resource sharing without a dedicated server </i>
    
<b>03) What is true about the Server Message Block protocol?</b>
    <i>Clients establish a long term connection to servers.</i>
    
<b>04) Which OSI layer provides the interface between the applications used to communicate and the underlying network over which messages are transmitted?</b>
    <i>Application </i>
        
<b>05) A manufacturing company subscribes to certain hosted services from its ISP. The services that are required include hosted world wide web, file transfer, and e-mail. Which protocols represent these three key applications? (Choose three.)</b>
    <i> FTP; SMTP; HTTP</i>

<b>06) What are two characteristics of peer-to-peer networks? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>Resource sharing without a dedicated server; Decentralized resources. </i>
    
<b>07) Which protocol is used by a client to communicate securely with a web server?</b>
    <i>HTTPS </i>
    
<b>08) Which three protocols operate at the application layer of the TCP/IP model? (Choose three.)</b>
    <i>FTP; POP3; DHCP </i>

<b>09) Which application layer protocol uses message types such as GET, PUT, and POST?</b>
    <i>HTTP </i>

<b>10) Which layer in the TCP/IP model is used for formatting, compressing, and encrypting data?</b>
    <i>application </i>
    
<b>11) Which applications or services allow hosts to act as client and server at the same time?</b>
    <i>P2P </i>
    
<b>12) Which two protocols may devices use in the application process that sends email? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>SMTP; DNS </i>

<b>13) The application layer of the TCP/IP model performs the functions of what three layers of the OSI model? (Choose three.)</b>
    <i>presentation; session; application </i>

<b>14) In what networking model would eDonkey, eMule, BitTorrent, Bitcoin, and LionShare be used?</b>
    <i>peer-to-peer </i>
    
<b>15) Which networking model is being used when an author uploads one chapter document to a file server of a book publisher?</b>
    <i>client/server </i>
    
<b>16) Which three fields are used in a UDP segment header? (Choose three.)</b>
    <i>Length; Checksum; Source Port </i>

<b>17) Which two fields are included in the TCP header but not in the UDP header? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>window; sequence number </i>

<b>18) Which factor determines TCP window size?</b>
    <i>the amount of data the destination can process at one time </i>
    
<b>19) Which two characteristics are associated with UDP sessions? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>destination devices receive traffic with minimal delay; Received data is unacknowledged </i>
    
<b>20) Which two types of applications are best suited for UDP? (Choose two.)</b>
    <i>applications that can tolerate some data loss, but require little or no delay; applications that handle reliability by themselves </i>

<b>21) Which protocol or service uses UDP for a client-to-server communication and TCP for server-to-server communication?</b>
    <i>DNS </i>

<b>22) How are port numbers used in the TCP/IP encapsulation process?</b>
    <i>If multiple conversations occur that are using the same service, the source port number is used to track the separate conversations. </i>
    
<b>23) Which flag in the TCP header is used in response to a received FIN in order to terminate connectivity between two network devices?</b>
    <i>ACK </i>
    
<b>24) What are three responsibilities of the transport layer? (Choose three.)</b>
    <i>meeting the reliability requirements of applications, if any; 
        multiplexing multiple communication streams from many users or applications on the same network;
        identifying the applications and services on the client and server that should handle transmitted data </i>

<b>25) A PC is downloading a large file from a server. The TCP window is 1000 bytes. The server is sending the file using 100-byte segments. 
       How many segments will the server send before it requires an acknowledgment from the PC?</b>
    <i>10 segments </i>
    
<b>26) What kind of port must be requested from IANA in order to be used with a specific application?</b>
    <i>registered port</i> 
    
<b>27) A client application needs to terminate a TCP communication session with a server. Place the termination process steps in the order that they will occur. (Not all options are used.)</b>
    <i>Step 1 = client sends FIN
       Step 2 = server sends ACK 
       Step 3 = server sends FIN
       Step 4 = client sends ACK  </i>
